Over the past few years, I've built and cloned several blogs, but something was always missing. While I was posting original content, the websites and services just didn't feel like "me."

Today, I released the first version of my own blog (built with AI Agents, of course). During this process, I realized how much our industry will change from 2025 onward. It's like the computer era of the 90s but with the power of AI.

We can either focus on building better models (competing for benchmarks) or continue shipping and building useful products using current architectures (transformers, diffusers, etc.).

This is my first attempt at writing a blog without using LLMs for content creation (just for grammar, since English isn't my first language). I'm posting anyway for the sake of learning, so please forgive any mistakes in my English â€“ I'll do my best.

2025 will be my year of focusing on learning and collaboration without expectations. Let's see what comes next!

Since I'm rebuilding this blog for the nth time, I've learned a life lesson: if you're struggling with something, keep trying. Everything you learn along the way will converge and connect to your present day, believe me!
