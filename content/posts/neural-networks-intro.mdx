# Introduction to Neural Networks

Neural networks are fascinating structures inspired by the human brain. Let's explore how they work and why they're so important in modern AI.

## What is a Neural Network?

At its core, a neural network is a series of algorithms that attempts to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics how the human brain operates.

## Key Components

1. Neurons (Nodes)
2. Connections (Weights)
3. Layers
4. Activation Functions

Stay tuned for more detailed posts about each component!
